Advanced Builder Design Patterns
Description
Welcome to the Advanced Builder Design Patterns repository! This repository showcases various sophisticated implementations of the Builder design pattern, each suited for different scenarios in software development. Builders are a crucial part of software design, enabling the creation of complex objects step-by-step. Our collection includes several distinct types of builders, each with unique features and applications.
Builders Included:

1.	Fluent Builder
o	Overview: The Fluent Builder uses method chaining to provide a fluent API for constructing objects. This approach enhances readability and allows for more expressive code.
o	Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where readability and simplicity are paramount, such as constructing configuration objects or complex data structures.

2.	Builder Parameter
o	Overview: The Builder Parameter pattern leverages parameter objects to encapsulate construction parameters. This method improves code clarity by grouping related parameters together.
o	Use Case: Suitable for functions or methods that require multiple parameters, reducing the need for numerous function overloads and improving maintainability.

3.	Builder Composite
o	Overview: The Builder Composite pattern combines the Builder pattern with the Composite pattern, allowing for the construction of tree-like structures. Each builder can build both individual elements and composite structures.
o	Use Case: Perfect for building hierarchical data structures, such as XML documents or UI component trees.

4.	Builder Functional Lazy
o	Overview: The Functional Lazy Builder uses a functional approach to delay the actual object construction until needed. This approach enhances performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
o	Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where object construction might be resource-intensive or where objects are not always required immediately.

5.	Builder Recursive Generic
o	Overview: The Builder Recursive Generic pattern uses generics to allow recursive building. This pattern is powerful for constructing complex objects with nested builders.
o	Use Case: Best suited for highly configurable objects where each component might also need to be built using a builder, such as DSLs (Domain Specific Languages).

6.	Step Wizard Builder
o	Overview: The Step Wizard Builder guides the user through the object construction process step-by-step, ensuring that mandatory steps are followed and optional steps can be skipped.
o	Use Case: Excellent for workflows where the construction process must follow a specific sequence, such as multi-step form wizards or setup processes.
How to Use
